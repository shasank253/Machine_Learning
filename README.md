# A heart disease prediction ML system is an advanced healthcare tool designed to assess the likelihood of an individual developing cardiovascular conditions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system analyzes various health parameters, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and lifestyle factors. It integrates historical data and patient records to identify patterns and correlations that may indicate a higher risk of heart disease. Such a system aims to assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and preventive care, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases.
